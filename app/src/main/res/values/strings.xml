        <big><b>Who are we?</b></big>
        <div>A group of students from Lodz University of Technology, the application you see was created as a part of our Mobile Systems course.</div>
        <br/>
        <big><b>What has driven us?</b></big>
        <div>During the 2020 a lot of people (us included) developed a habit of checking the covid statistics on a daily basis, sometimes as a first thing we did after waking up instead of scrolling through social media. This acted as a source of anxiety and anger, but was still irresistibly tempting. We realized, that it was because of the engagement-inciting nature of their delivery, trying to blow out of proportion everything that can cause strong emotions.</div>
        <br/>
        <big><b>Why this app?</b></big>
        <div>We know that nothing would stop the news publishers from what they are doing as they profit from increasing the engagement of their viewers. The only way to do something is proposing our own alternative. And that is what we did.</div>
        <div>We hope the app gives you an experience not overloaded with stimulus, providing a concise, non biased insight into the development of the pandemic in different countries. Please, in addition to that read the Important Info section to improve your knowledge about recognizing misleading statistics. <strong>Stay save and well!</strong></div>
